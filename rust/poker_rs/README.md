RS Poker is a rust library aimed at being a good starting place
for lots of poker rust code. Correctness and performance are the two main goals.

## Core

The Core module contains code that is not specific to different
types of poker games. It contains:

* Suit type
* Value type
* Card type
* Deck
* Hand iteration
* Poker hand rank type
* Poker hand evaluation for five card hands.
* Poker hand evaluation for seven card hands.
* PlayerBitSet suitable for keeping track of boolean values on a table.

The poker hand (5 card) evaluation will rank a hand in ~20 nanoseconds
per hand. That means that 50 Million hands per second can be
ranked. The seven card hand evaluation will rank a hand in < 25 ns.

The hand evaluation is is fully accurate, it does not rely on just single
kicker. This allows for breaking ties on hands that are closer.


## Holdem

The holdem module contains code that is specific to holdem. It
currently contains:

* Starting hand enumeration
* Hand range parsing
* Monte Carlo game simulation helpers.

## Arena

*Arena is currently a beta feature. There are no planned breaking changes, but additions are expected.*


Arena is a feature that allows creating agents that play a simulated
Texas Holdem poker game; these autonomous agent vs agent games are
great for determining strength of automated strategies. Additionally
agent vs agent arenas are a good way of playing lots of GTO poker quickly.

* Holdem simulation struct for overall status of the simulation
* Game state for the state of the current game
* Agent trait that can be implemented to create your own poker agent.
* A few example Agents.

## Testing

The code is pretty well tested and benchmarked. If you find
something that looks like a bug please submit a pr with test
code.

5 Card + Hand iteration has been used in conjunction with fuzzing to validate
the seven card hand evaluation.
