//Need a game_runner, except one position will be the agent we're training
//When it's the agents turn, we get an array of actions from it it would like to prototype

// The actions go into a queue which holds --
// Infostate of agent (or id of it)
// Gamestate

// Once this gamestate reaches the end of the hand, update the agents data
// with infostate + action == result (chips won/lost in bb)

//For subsequent actions, we'll maybe just have additional infostates to update
