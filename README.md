Next step --

eval river

start extra attributes on hand eval, or 
look at differences between flop hand and turn/river hand


ok somehow simulate both villians, maybe dealing and waiting until the cards satify their constraints

-or- we simulate them folding


so deal my cards
then the flop

these are fixed

then simulate dealing villians cards for 4 other players

record flop situation

simulate hero betting
